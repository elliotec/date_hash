Hash challenge-

This ruby file uses the Date library and reassigns the integers of weekdays in that library to new strings that represent the first 2 letters of the weekday, such as "Fr".

It prompts the user for a year, month, and date, then outputs the abbreviation of the weekday of that date for any day ever.
